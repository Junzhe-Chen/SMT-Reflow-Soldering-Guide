# SMT reflow documentation

What you need before soldering:

- PCB
- Stencil for that PCB
- All the SMT components you need, please check with the BOM of that PCB
    - Please note it would be really helpful if you mark the value of the capacitor after taking from the reel
- Some tapes to fix the board into position
- Solder paste, usually you need to leave it to the room temperature for it to warmup
- Plastic or metal piece to flatter the paste

Before doing anything, check the PCB with the stencil to make sure it fits

First step of SMT soldering is to fix the PCB in place. Make sure that the tape does not cover any part of the pads. Make sure that the four angles are all fixed into place so that the PCB does not move when you scraping the paste (apply pressure)

Align the stencil onto the PCB, make sure that the alignment is perfect so that when applying the paste, it goes all into the pad. If there is any bulge, try tp flatten it with hand and taut at the end before applying the tape to the other end
Scraping solder paste onto it, make sure to scrape it generously and evenly, this step would be important for the following process

This is what it should look like after applying the solder paste

Under the microscope, it should look like this. The paste should align with the pad and has certain thickness

Placing the components with the help of the microscope. The following picture shows my setup while working with SMT components placements. The left computer has the PCB file open so that makes tracking component and its value easy. The right computer is connected to the microscope to help me working with small SMT components

This is how things looks like under the microscope

This is what should look like after all the components are being placed. Doublecheck with the microscope to ensure that every pad has the paste onto it and every components are aligned with the pad

Put the board onto the oven, remember putting it slowly and gently making sure that the components does not misalign with the pad. Use twessers to help if needed

Usually, you need to wait for a solid 4-5 minutes and let the oven to do the job. After everything is done, the PCB should look like this

![Final product](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/SMT-Reflow-Soldering-Guide/assets/141964509/ce3838e6-d087-441c-be56-e60efb82b765)

Double check with all the connections, and if everything is right, you get your board soldered.

In the future, I would add more methods related to working with SMT components on a PCB. The future work includes
- SMT soldering using a heated pad
- SMT soldering using hot air
- BGA soldering techniques

I would upload these materials sooner or later, when everything is ready.

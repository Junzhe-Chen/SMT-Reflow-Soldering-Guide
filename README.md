# SMT reflow documentation

What you need before soldering:

- PCB
- Stencil for that PCB
- All the SMT components you need, please check with the BOM of that PCB
    - Please note it would be really helpful if you mark the value of the capacitor after taking from the reel
- Some tapes to fix the board into position
- Solder paste, usually you need to leave it to the room temperature for it to warmup
- Plastic or metal piece to flatter the paste

Before doing anything, check the PCB with the stencil to make sure it fits

First step of SMT soldering is to fix the PCB in place. Make sure that the tape does not cover any part of the pads. Make sure that the four angles are all fixed into place so that the PCB does not move when you scraping the paste (apply pressure)

Align the stencil onto the PCB, make sure that the alignment is perfect so that when applying the paste, it goes all into the pad. If there is any bulge, try tp flatten it with hand and taut at the end before applying the tape to the other end

Scraping solder paste onto it, make sure to scrape it generously and evenly, this step would be important for the following process

This is what it should looks like after applying the solder paste

Under the microscope, it should look like this. The paste should align with the pad and has certain thickness

Placing the components with the help of the microscope (which is located at the most right side of the first row of the lab.

This is what should look like after all the components are being placed. Doublecheck with the microscope to ensure that every pad has the paste onto it and every components are aligned with the pad

This is my setup when I am doing the SMT work. The left computer has the PCB file open so that it makes reading the component value easy. The right side displays the image under the microscope

Put the board onto the oven, remember putting it slowly and gently making sure that the components does not misalign with the pad. Use twessers to help if needed

All done,
